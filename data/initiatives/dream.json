    "Privacy has been pronounced dead; allegedly “free” services cost us troves of personal data; our governments know more about us than we do ourselves. No one actually “Agrees” to these “Conditions”, yet short of abandoning all modern conveniences, resistance seems futile. But fear not! There are loads of projects and people working on ways to take back our digital agency. Data Rules Everything Around Me (d.r.e.a.m.) is a roughly-monthly series devoted to openly discussing these topics. Featured writers, artists, developers and other cultural producers are invited to share their research and perspectives on the data that fuels the systems that run our world."

I think the more we take time to actually look at all these individuals pieces, from cable to code, [the more] we have the opportunity to challenge and change the way it’s working.”",

She’s written for and worked with institutions along these lines including Eyebeam, eyeo, Data and Society Research Institute, Deep Lab, the Atlantic and the Nation among others. She’ll be sharing with us some of the teaching tools and perspectives she’s developed for thinking about how to integrate network infrastructure into the digital literacy dialogue and how we consider political questions when talking about things like fiber optic cables, cell towers, roads and bridges.
