    "BrowserFest was a friendly online competition and celebration of creative coding inspired by the playful and dynamic demoparty format. It was a virtual festival bent on fostering the artful development of and experimentation with the web. For a little over one month participants explored making, remixing, and hacking the web through live sessions, interactive tutorials, and handy starter (code) packs. The fest culminated in a realtime interactive online event with browser based performances and prizes awarded to the winners."
