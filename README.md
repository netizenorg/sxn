re:
1.

1.b: apart from the font-size, weren't there also some font-family changes Nadine mentioned on our call?



6. yes (but maybe after launch) i still need icons (especially for playable videos)

7. That's a good piont, but don't think it's an issue righ now thought? At present, every image you see in the grid will link to something. The only one that doesn't is the image of us in the "About" sectin, but that one also doesn't have any syrup at all, nor does your mouse turn into a "pointer" icon when u hover over it like the other clickable images. The home page includes a syrup version of that picture of us, but that one is clickable (it's another route to the "About" page). Was there another item u noticed that had syrup on it but wasn't clickable? (that might have been a bug)

8. great! awaiting ur recs/changes to the pop pages :)
